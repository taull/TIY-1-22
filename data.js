As I LOVE what I do, I also LOVE my beautiful family and spending time with them. That being said... if you make a purchase or send me a message after 6pm (my time), then I will reply to you or your purchase will be emailed over the next day.  Sunday mornings are set aside for church, so please allow time for me to return from Church to send them on Sundays.  All purchases will be emailed within 24 hours unless otherwise notified.  I really work hard to get purchases emailed in a timely manner.  We are all human, have busy lives and things come up... so please try to understand if I can&#39;t send your purchase right away.  The formats I send are: DST, EXP, HUS, JEF, PES, SEW, VIP, VP3 or XXX.  I can not convert to ART.  If no format is noted at your time of check out, I will automatically send format PES.  If you need a different format, just email me and let me know.  I am happy to send the correct format over.  Custom Designs have become a huge part of what I do, so please give me 2-3 weeks to get them finished.  Font sets may take longer... Sometimes the designs are sent much quicker than that, but I do get backed up at times.  Please know that I do EXCLUSIVE designs on LOGOS ONLY.  Please send me a convo for Logo fees.  A picture of your logo will be needed in order for me to create it and also written permission from the owner of the artwork to re-create their logo into an embroidery format.  Prices for logos will vary depending on the complexity of the logo. Designs that are not logos WILL NOT be exclusive.  All other designs (non-logos) created WILL be posted for re-sale on my site.  It&#39;s just ME. :) Refunds will be considered based on the situation.  There are no refunds or exchanges once the files have been emailed.  There is NO sharing, copying, or re-selling of my work.  I work very hard to create these designs for you to enjoy.  Please respect my hard work as I will continue to create many more for you to enjoy.  You may sell an item with my design on it (t-shirts, onesies, bibs, towels, etc...) ~ Just not sell the actual design itself.  The Free Font or Design for the Buy 2 Get 1 Free Fonts or Designs Special must be of equal or lesser value.  Do NOT purchase the free font.  You must list it in the notes at check out.  You will NOT get a refund or credit for purchasing the free fonts.  If you wish to cancel an order that has not been emailed to you yet, or hasn&#39;t been downloaded then I am happy to refund your purchase. All Instant Download files are your responsibility to download.  If there is a format that is not a choice for instant download, you must convo me your format or list it in the notes at check out.  If you don&#39;t then I will assume you will download one of the formats available for instant download.  I have the right to refuse a sale to anyone.\r\n\r\nI enjoy working with everyone and I hope you enjoy my designs as much as I enjoy watching you print them out. :)\r\n\r\nHappy Stitching!\r\nJamie Aldridge","policy_shipping":"All fonts and designs will be emailed to your email address that is provided through Etsy within 24 hours of purchase.

Custom Orders must be paid for in advance.  I will then work on the images and send you drafts until you are happy with the images.**  Once you have okayed the final draft, I will finish up the collage sheet and email it out to you.  This completes the transaction.
